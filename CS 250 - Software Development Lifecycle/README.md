## Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating user stories help with this?

I interpret user needs by focusing on what the user is trying to accomplish rather than immediately jumping into technical solutions. In this course, creating user stories helped translate vague or high-level requirements into clear, actionable goals written from the perspective of the user. User stories made it easier to break work into manageable tasks and prioritize features based on perceived value. This approach ensures that development remains aligned with user expectations while also providing a clear structure for implementation and testing.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approached program development iteratively, building functionality in small increments and improving it through continuous feedback. Agile practices such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives help keep development organized and adaptable. In my future work, I hope to continue using these Agile processes to improve communication, identify issues early, and adjust plans as requirements evolve. This approach supports higher-quality software and more predictable progress.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means communicating clearly, collaborating respectfully, and taking responsibility for assigned work. It also involves being open to feedback, supporting teammates, and contributing to team goals rather than focusing only on individual tasks. Throughout this course, I learned that effective teamwork is essential for successful Agile development and helps ensure that projects stay on track and meet user needs.
