This repository contains the completed Software Design Document developed for The Gaming Room as part of the CS 230 course. The client, The Gaming Room, sought to expand their existing game, Draw It or Lose It, from an Android-only application into a web-based, distributed system capable of supporting multiple teams and players across different platforms. The software needed to ensure unique game instances, team names, and players while maintaining scalability, efficient resource management, and consistent game state across sessions.

One of the strongest aspects of this documentation was my ability to clearly communicate technical design decisions, particularly in explaining system architecture, platform considerations, and deployment options. I focused on presenting these concepts in a way that would be understandable to both technical team members and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that the client’s goals and constraints were clearly reflected in the design.

Working through the design document before implementation was especially helpful because it encouraged careful planning and problem decomposition. Defining requirements, constraints, and architectural components upfront provided a clear roadmap for development and reduced potential issues during coding. The design process made it easier to align implementation decisions with the client’s needs and long-term scalability goals.

If I were to revise one part of this work, I would expand on the architectural and domain model details by including more visual diagrams and deeper explanations of component interactions. This would improve clarity and make the document even more useful for future developers working on the project.

User needs were interpreted by prioritizing scalability, cross-platform accessibility, and consistent user experience. These needs were implemented through architectural decisions such as centralized game services and enforcing unique identifiers for games, teams, and players. Considering user needs is essential in software design because it ensures the final product is usable, reliable, and aligned with business objectives.

Overall, my approach to software design involved analyzing requirements, evaluating constraints, and selecting appropriate architectural solutions based on scalability and maintainability. In future projects, I would continue using structured design techniques such as requirement analysis, UML modeling, and iterative refinement to design effective and user-centered software applications.
